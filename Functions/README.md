**Purpose of Task** </br>
The purpose of this task is to calculate a user's total holiday cost, which includes the plane cost, hotel cost, nd car-rental cost.

**Why is it important to learn about Functions?** </br>
It is key for a developer to learn how to write functions, as functions are self-contained modules of code that accomplish a specific task. Usually functions "take in" data, process it, and "return" a result. Once a function is written, it can be used over and over again. The other benefit of functions is that it can be "called" from inside other functions.
