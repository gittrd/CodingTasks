In this task, you will be exposed to loop statements to understand how they can be
utilised in reducing lengthy code, preventing coding errors, and paving the way
toward code reusability.

Weâ€™ll then move on to the for-loop structure to understand how it can be
employed to iterate over sequences, executing a block of code a predetermined
number of times determined by the sequence's length.
