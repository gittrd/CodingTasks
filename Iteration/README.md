# Coding Task - Iteration

**Purpose of Task** </br>
The purpose of this task is to practice Iteration, specifically loops statements in order to understand how they can be utilised in reducing lengthy code, preventing coding errors, and paving the way towards code reusability.
Furthermore, also practice how the for-loop structure can be employed to iterate over sequences, executing a block of code a predetermined number of times.

**Why is it important to learn about Iteration?** </br>
Iteration is a valuable tool to know, as it performs specific tasks. Iteration enables a program or application to cycle repeatedly through different inputs and outputs, depending on the type of loop desired. If one is programming repetitive processes, iteration can be extremly useful.
