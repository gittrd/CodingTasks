# Coding Task - OOP Modules & MVC

**Purpose of Task** </br>
The purpose of this task is to practice OOP Modules and MVC. 

**Why is it important to learn OOP Modules and MVC?** </br>
As already stated within OOP Classes, object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.
Furthermore, Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components; 1) the model, 2) the view, and 3) the controller. Each of these components are built to handle specific development aspects of an application.
