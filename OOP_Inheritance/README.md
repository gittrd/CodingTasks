# Coding Task - OOP Inheritance

**Purpose of Task** </br>
The purpose of this task is to practice OOP Inheritance, and learn how inheritance enables me to reuse code from existing classes in new classes and include additional logic or variations on the logic.

**Why is OOP Inheritance Important?** </br>
Inheritance is one of the core pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP), as it enables the creation of new classes that inherit attributes and behaviours from existing classes, improving code reusability and overall efficiency.
