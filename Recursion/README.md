Recursion is a handy programming tool that, in many cases, enables you to develop a
straightforward, simple solution to an otherwise complex problem. However, it is often
difficult to determine how a program can be approached recursively. In this task, we
explain the basic concepts of recursive programming and teach you to “think
recursively”.
