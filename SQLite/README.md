# Coding Task - SQLite

**Purpose of Task** </br>
The aim of this task is to learn how to write code to create and manipulate a database with SQLite.

**Why is SQLite important?** </br>
One of the main difference between SQLite and other SQL databases is their architecture. While most SQL databases use a client-server model, SQLite uses a serverless, file-based architecture.
