Testing is an integral aspect of software development, playing a pivotal role in
ensuring the reliability, functionality, and maintainability of applications. Unit tests,
in particular, form the foundation of this process by validating individual
components of code to catch errors early in the development cycle. Python comes
with a built-in testing framework called unittest. We utilise this module to write
unit tests for this task. Test-Driven Development (TDD), a methodology embraced
by many developers, follows the practice of writing tests before production code.
